# add feature scaling - range (-1 to 1). consider values that are in range -0.001 to 0.001
# to calculate division factor for scaling, using max-min or sd
# assert that scales range between -3 to 3 and -1/3 to 1/3 OR emit warning
# also add mean normalization (subtract all values by mean) to make mean = 0
# use derivatives
